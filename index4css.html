    <p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. 
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: 
        a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. 
        Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.</p>

        <h2>Ninjas available for hire</h2>
        <p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ninja yoshi</li>
            <li>Ninja Mario</li>
            <li>Ninja Shaun</li>
        </ul>
